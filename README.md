![My Sway Build](https://i.ibb.co/ZSXs6Pd/Reddit.png)

Sway build for people who need just to focus on things for a long periods without any distracting or anything which hurts eyes. I tried to configure everything just to focus on things to be done.

Yes, there is no any sexy stuff like custom launcher with widgets, blur, or drop shadow. I think they give "wow" effect only for a short period, a good design are usually things that you don't notice at first glance. In my previous builds I tried to use every tweak (transparency, blur, etc) to rice it as much as I could (my old Awesome build: https://ibb.co/d7nQqSC), but it hurts my eyes and made coding unpleasing.

I dislike most of the bars, from WM's bars to titlebars, because they visually narrow down things and make me feel constrained (claustrophobic). Also there is an outer gap as a background lighting, it helps my eyes to be focused on my work for way more period.
